# CIFAR-10 IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING ML

The project is a machine learning project that focuses on building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes include airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.
